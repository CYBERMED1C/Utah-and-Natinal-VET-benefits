Utah-and-Natinal-VET-benefits

Great — I’ll compile a detailed breakdown of all federal and Utah state veteran benefits, discounts, education options, and free services for disabled veterans at each major VA disability rating (0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 90%, and 100%). I’ll include specific details for areas around Hill Air Force Base, including Davis, Weber, Salt Lake, and nearby counties.

I’ll dig into official state sites, VA resources, and community posts (like Reddit) to make sure this report covers every benefit available. I’ll let you know when it’s ready for your review.


# Utah Veteran Benefits by VA Disability Rating (Northern Utah Focus)

Below is a comprehensive breakdown of federal and Utah-specific benefits available to veterans at various VA disability rating levels. Benefits are organized by percentage rating, and cover financial/tax relief, state/county discounts, education, services, housing, employment, healthcare, license/vehicle perks, travel, and local programs near Hill Air Force Base (Davis, Weber, Salt Lake counties).

## 0% Disability Rating (Service-Connected with No VA Compensation)

Even without monetary VA compensation, a veteran with a 0% service-connected rating (or any honorably discharged veteran) is eligible for many benefits:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **State Income Tax:** VA disability compensation is **tax-free** at both federal and state levels. (At 0%, no comp is paid, but any future VA comp would be tax-exempt.) Utah also **exempts military retirement pay** from state income tax via a credit (4.65% of the pension). Surviving spouses’ SBP annuities get a similar credit.
  * **Property Tax Exemption:** Not yet eligible (requires ≥10% rating). No Utah property tax relief at 0%.
  * **Disabled Veterans’ Life Insurance:** Veterans with any service-connected rating can apply for VA life insurance (e.g. **VALife**, which replaced S-DVI in 2023) with no health exam.

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * **Utah State Parks Pass:** Veterans with *any* service-connected disability rating qualify for the **Veterans With Disabilities Honor Pass**, granting free day-use entry to all Utah state parks for the veteran and up to 7 guests. (Excludes This Is The Place Heritage Park and Antelope Island causeway fee.)
  * **Driver License Veteran Indicator:** Any honorably discharged Utah veteran can add a “VETERAN” designation on their driver license or ID (proof of service required).
  * **Disabled Veteran License Plate:** Veterans with any VA disability rating can obtain a Utah DV license plate. *(Note: The DV plate **does not** automatically confer handicapped parking privileges without a separate ADA placard).* This plate can be personalized and transferred to an unremarried surviving spouse.
  * **Veteran License Plates:** Utah also offers plates for Purple Heart recipients, former POWs, etc. Purple Heart recipients’ registration fees are **waived for one vehicle** (they still pay age-based property fees).

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **GI Bill & In-State Tuition:** Veterans can use federal GI Bill benefits for education (not rating-dependent). Utah public schools grant in-state tuition to veterans using GI Bill benefits (per federal law).
  * **Veterans Tuition Gap Program:** If a veteran exhausts the Post-9/11 GI Bill but hasn’t finished a degree, Utah’s **Tuition Gap** program can cover up to one year of undergrad tuition (must be a Utah resident and meet other criteria).
  * **Purple Heart Tuition Waiver:** If the veteran earned a Purple Heart, Utah waives tuition at state public colleges up to a master’s degree.
  * **High School Diploma Programs:** Vietnam/Korean War-era veterans who left school for service may obtain honorary high school diplomas (through local school districts).

* **Free/Reduced-Cost Services:**

  * **VA Healthcare Enrollment:** A 0% service-connected veteran is eligible to enroll in VA health care. Treatment for the specific 0% condition is free, though co-pays may apply for other care (Priority Group 6 or 8 depending on income).
  * **Vet Centers:** Combat veterans (and certain others) can access **Ogden Vet Center** counseling services for free (readjustment counseling, MST support, etc.), regardless of disability rating.
  * **Legal Aid:** Utah’s **Utah\@Ease** program provides pro bono legal assistance to veterans, active service, Guard/Reserve members and families. Common issues include wills, powers of attorney, service-member rights, etc. (Utah\@Ease matches veterans with volunteer attorneys). The VA Salt Lake also hosts a free monthly legal clinic in Southern Utah.
  * **Recreation:** Disabled veterans (any rating) qualify for the **National Park Service Access Pass**, a free lifetime pass for national parks/federal lands (with documentation of a permanent disability). Many local businesses, museums, and events in Northern Utah offer veteran discounts or free admission on Veterans Day (e.g. free meals, discounted event tickets – see UDVMA’s Veterans Day Discounts list).

* **Housing Programs:**

  * **VA Home Loans:** All honorably discharged vets can apply for VA home loan certificates (not rating-dependent) – useful for buying homes with \$0 down.
  * **Utah First-Time Homebuyer Grant:** Recently separated veterans (within 5 years of discharge) can get a **\$2,500 grant** toward a first home in Utah. This state program is funded and active as of 2025.
  * **Utah Veterans Nursing Homes:** Utah has four State Veterans Homes (nursing care facilities in Ogden, Salt Lake City, Payson, and Ivins) open to veterans and spouses. Wartime veterans and those with service-connected disabilities get priority admission. Costs are based on income/needs, with VA subsidies for service-connected conditions.
  * **Homeless Veterans:** Northern Utah vets in crisis can seek help from the **Homeless Veterans Fellowship (HVF)** in Ogden, a nonprofit providing up to 18 months of transitional housing, counseling, and job assistance. The VA Salt Lake City also operates “Valor House” transitional housing for homeless veterans.

* **Employment Benefits:**

  * **Veterans Hiring Preference (State):** Utah provides a hiring preference for veterans in state government jobs. Qualified vets (honorable discharge, served ≥180 days) get **points added to passing exam scores** for state employment. Spouses of disabled vets and unremarried surviving spouses also qualify. (Typically +5 points for veterans, +10 for service-connected disabled or Purple Heart veterans.)
  * **Veterans Hiring Preference (Federal):** At the federal level, veterans with any service-connected disability qualify for **10-point hiring preference** on federal job applications. (5-point preference is for wartime or campaign medal vets; 10-point for VA disability.) Veterans with ≥30% disability have a higher preference category (CPS).
  * **State Employment Services:** Utah’s Department of Workforce Services has Disabled Veteran Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists to assist vets with employment, resumes, and training. All Utah employers with public contracts also offer priority of service to veterans.

* **Healthcare Access:**

  * **VA Medical Facilities:** Northern Utah veterans can use the **George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center** in Salt Lake City and VA outpatient clinics in Ogden, Orem, etc. Even with 0% rating, veterans may receive free care for service-connected conditions and can apply for income-based care for others.
  * **TRICARE (Retirees):** 0% disability does not affect TRICARE eligibility; however, retirees and dependents maintain TRICARE as usual (unrelated to VA rating).
  * **Caregiver Support:** Veterans of any rating injured in the line of duty after 9/11 with serious injuries may have caregiver support options through the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance (needs VA evaluation).

* **License/Vehicle/Travel Benefits:**

  * **Utah Disabled Veteran Plate:** (See above under discounts.) Displaying this plate or a VA/DoD veteran ID can unlock additional perks like airport parking.
  * **Vehicle Registration:** No special fee waivers at 0% aside from Purple Heart recipients (who are exempt from registration/license fees). However, once eligible for the property tax exemption (10%+), that benefit *can* apply to the annual vehicle property tax (“age-based fee”) as well – see 10% section.
  * **Base Commissary & Exchange:** **All service-connected veterans (0% and up)** have military post access to shop at commissaries and Exchanges and use MWR facilities as of 2020. To access Hill AFB or other bases, the veteran can present a VA Veteran Health ID Card (*VHIC* marked “Service Connected”) at the visitor gate.
  * **Space-Available Travel:** Not eligible at 0%. (Requires 100% P\&T – see 100% section.)
  * **Airport Parking:** As of 2024, Salt Lake City International Airport offers **free parking** for vehicles with Utah DV plates or for veterans showing a VA/DoD ID. This covers up to **5 days in the airport garage or 10 days in economy lot** per trip. *Beyond those days, normal rates apply.* To use this, the DV plate must be displayed or the veteran must show a VA VHIC or DoD 100% ID at the parking cashier.
  * **Utah Transit (UTA):** Veterans with disabilities can get **reduced fare UTA passes**. A VA service-connected disability of **40% or higher** qualifies for about **50–65% off** local bus/TRAX fares. (At 0% alone, not eligible unless other criteria like age 65 or Medicare apply.)

* **Local Community Programs (Hill AFB Area):**

  * **County Veteran Offices:** Davis, Weber, and Salt Lake counties have Veteran Service Officers to help with VA claims and local resources. They also administer property tax exemptions. (E.g. **Weber County Veterans Office** provides information on tax relief, local events, and county services for vets.)
  * **Recreation Discounts:** Many city recreation centers near Hill AFB offer military/veteran discounts. For example, Layton City’s Surf ‘n Swim offers reduced punch-pass rates for military. Check local city parks & rec programs in Clearfield, Roy, Ogden, etc. – many give vets resident pricing or senior rates.
  * **Veterans Treatment Court:** Both Weber and Davis Counties participate in Veterans Court programs (for justice-involved veterans, offering treatment in lieu of jail for those with service-related issues).
  * **Community Events & Support:** Cities around Hill AFB host Veterans Day parades, military appreciation nights, and volunteer programs (e.g. Utah Veterans Outdoors provides free outdoor excursions/therapy for veterans). While not financial benefits, these contribute to quality of life.

## 10% Disability Rating

A 10% VA rating is the first level that pays monthly compensation, and it opens the door to additional benefits on top of those available at 0%. A veteran rated 10% is entitled to **all the benefits listed for 0%**, plus the following enhancements:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Disability Compensation:** Monthly tax-free compensation from the VA begins at 10%. (For example, the 2025 rate for 10% is about \$175 per month.) While 10% is a relatively low payment, it establishes the veteran’s **“compensable” service-connected status**.
  * **Utah Property Tax Exemption:** Begins at **10% disability**. The veteran can get a property tax exemption on their primary residence equal to **10% of the maximum \$505,548** exclusion amount. For a 10% rating, that is up to about **\$50,555** of home value tax-free. This can save a few hundred dollars in property taxes, depending on local rates. (The exemption scales with rating – see higher ratings below for details.) The veteran must file an application with the county by Sept 1, including a VA letter confirming the disability percentage. *Note:* If the vet has no home, this benefit can be applied to a vehicle’s property tax (the age-based fee) instead.
  * **VA Vocational Readiness (Chapter 31):** At 10% with an employment handicap, a veteran **can access Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment** (now Veteran Readiness & Employment) services. This program pays for tuition or training and provides a stipend to help vets overcome barriers to employment (requires VA evaluation of an employment impact).
  * **Federal Hiring Preference:** At 10%+, the veteran qualifies for the **10-point federal hiring preference** (CP or CPS category) on competitive federal jobs.
  * **Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP):** If the veteran is a military retiree, note that CRDP (which lets retirees receive full VA comp *and* military retirement pay without offset) kicks in at **50%**, so 10%–40% retirees still have an offset. However, **Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC)** could be an option if the disability is combat-related.

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * **Utah Disabled Veteran Plate:** Already eligible (any rating). If not obtained at 0%, the veteran can now get the DV plate with their VA award letter.
  * **Utah State Parks Honor Pass:** Already eligible (any rating) – continue to use annually.
  * **Hunting & Fishing Licenses:** Not yet – the discount requires 20%+. (However, at 10% the veteran can apply as soon as their rating increases. See 20%+ under 30% section.)
  * **Free/Reduced Vehicle Registration:** **Purple Heart recipients** (if also rated 10%) continue to receive a full waiver of Utah registration and license fees on one vehicle. The 10% VA rating itself doesn’t grant this (it’s tied to the medal, not percentage).
  * **UTA Transit Reduced Fare:** Not yet (needs 40%+).
  * **Local Discounts:** The veteran should inquire about **county-issued Veteran ID cards** (some counties offer ID cards or certificates for vets to get local merchant discounts). Also, Davis County Libraries offer **fee waivers on late fines** for veterans in some cases (varies by library).

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Chapter 35 Dependents’ Education (DEA):** Not applicable at 10%. (DEA requires the veteran be rated 100% P\&T or died of service-connection.)
  * **Vocational Training for Dependents:** If the veteran’s 10% rating is for a severe condition, minor dependents might access state programs for children with disabilities (not specific to veteran status).
  * *(All other education benefits from 0% still apply: GI Bill, Tuition Gap, Purple Heart waiver, etc.)* Additionally, a 10% rating may make the vet **eligible for priority enrollment** or veteran support services at colleges (e.g. tutoring or special advising for vets).

* **Free/Reduced-Cost Services:**

  * **VA Healthcare Priority:** At 10%, the veteran is assigned to Priority Group 3 or 4 for that condition’s care, which may reduce some co-pays. Any treatment for the service-connected disability is free.
  * **VA Travel Reimbursement:** Veterans with **30% or higher** ratings get travel pay for any VA medical appointments (see 30%). At 10%, the veteran can still receive **mileage reimbursement** when traveling for care of the service-connected condition specifically.
  * **Caregiver Support:** With a 10% rating, if the veteran has a significant injury/illness incurred in service requiring a caregiver, they or their caregiver might be eligible for the VA’s Program of General Caregiver Support Services (even if not meeting the P\&T criteria of the Comprehensive program).
  * **Legal Services:** Same free legal clinic access as 0%. The **Utah Veterans Legal Clinic** (in SLC) is open monthly to help with discharge upgrades, landlord-tenant issues, etc. and 10% vets qualify.
  * **Mental Health:** The veteran can access **VA mental health care**; any service-connected mental health condition would be treated without charge. If the 10% is for PTSD or similar, they may also be eligible for specialized treatment programs at the VA (group therapy, etc.). The vet can also use the Vet Center (combat veterans or MST survivors).
  * **Adaptive Sports:** With a service-connected disability, veterans can join programs like the **National Ability Center** in Utah or VA adaptive sports (e.g. skiing programs at Snowbasin or Sundance for disabled vets) often at low or no cost.

* **Housing & Insurance:**

  * **VA Home Grants:** At 10%, not eligible for Specially Adapted Housing grants (those require severe disabilities like loss of limbs/vision).
  * **Homebuyer Program:** Still within 5-year window if applicable (see 0% section).
  * **Insurance:** The veteran can consider **Service-Disabled Veterans’ Life Insurance (VALife)** – available to any level of service-connected vet, which provides up to \$40,000 life insurance with premiums (no medical underwriting) if under age 80 when enrolling.

* **Employment:**

  * **VR\&E (Veteran Readiness & Employment):** As noted, 10% with an employment handicap can receive vocational rehabilitation services – a big benefit for career training or education beyond the GI Bill. This can include counseling, job placement, and up to 48 months of education benefits (tuition, books, fees, and a monthly stipend).
  * **State Hiring Preference:** Same as at 0%, but if the veteran’s 10% disability makes them a **“disabled veteran” under state law,** they and their spouse may each qualify for the higher preference tier in Utah state jobs (usually +10% to scores).
  * **Federal Jobs & Schedule A:** Any service-connected disability qualifies the veteran for **Schedule A excepted service hiring** in federal employment – meaning they can be hired non-competitively for federal jobs if qualified. This is a fast-track hiring authority for disabled vets (no need to go through the full USAJobs competitive process).
  * **Entrepreneurship:** Utah offers resources for veteran entrepreneurs (regardless of rating) – e.g. the Utah Veteran Owned Business Partnership and workshops through SBA. There’s no additional state business tax break at 10%, but being a certified veteran-owned or service-disabled-veteran-owned business (SDVOSB) can help in federal contracting.

* **Healthcare:**

  * **VA Healthcare Coverage:** The veteran is likely in **Priority Group 3** (veterans with 10-20% SC) for VA healthcare – which means lower co-pays than PG 6/7. If the veteran has combat service (e.g. OEF/OIF), they might have enhanced eligibility.
  * **Hearing Aids/Eyeglasses:** Veterans with a compensable SC rating (10%+) are **eligible for hearing aids and eyeglasses from VA** if recommended by a VA doctor. This can be a valuable benefit since these devices can be very costly out of pocket.
  * **Dental:** Outpatient dental care from VA is **not** available at 10% unless the dental issue is service-connected or the veteran was a POW. (Comprehensive VA dental requires 100% or dental-specific rating.)

* **License/Vehicle/Travel:**

  * **Utah Property Tax on Vehicles:** Now that the veteran has a 10% rating, they can use their property tax exemption toward **motor vehicles** if they don’t use the full amount on a home. For example, they can present their exemption certificate to offset the age-based tax on their car, boat, RV, etc..
  * **Utah Disabled Veteran Plate:** If not already obtained, the veteran should get it now for recognition and perks like free airport parking (as described in 0% section).
  * **Base Access:** Same as 0% – can shop at Hill AFB commissary/Exchange, use base recreation (e.g. Hill AFB golf course, equipment rentals, on-base ticket office for discounted tickets, etc.). The VHIC card showing “Service Connected” is used for access.
  * **Space-A Travel:** Not yet (100% P\&T only).
  * **Travel Discounts:** Many airlines, hotels, and rental car agencies offer military/veteran discounts regardless of rating (usually just need a veteran ID or proof of service). E.g., some hotels in Ogden/Layton have military rates that vets can ask for. A 10% rating doesn’t change this, but carrying a VA award letter or VHIC can serve as proof of veteran status where needed.

* **Local Community Programs:**

  * All community resources from 0% apply. Additionally, with a 10% rating, the veteran can engage with local **support groups for disabled vets**. For instance, the American Legion or VFW in Ogden/Clearfield have service officers who prioritize helping disabled veterans file for increases or connect to resources.
  * **Davis/Weber County Veterans Courts:** If the veteran ever needs it (hopefully not), having any VA rating often makes one eligible for diversion to veterans court for minor offenses, where mentoring and treatment are provided instead of jail.
  * **Northern Utah Veterans Cemetery:** The vet is eligible for burial at the **Utah Veterans Memorial Cemetery** in Bluffdale with no plot cost. This was true at 0% as well (any honorably discharged vet). Spouses can be buried there for a small fee.

## 30% Disability Rating

At 30% VA disability, veterans receive higher compensation and unlock several new benefits (while of course keeping all those at lower ratings). A 30% rating often signifies multiple or more severe conditions. **All benefits listed for 10% (and 0%) apply**, with the following additions or changes:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Compensation Increase:** Monthly VA compensation at 30% is substantially higher than 10%. For example, a 30% rating pays about \$508 per month (single) and **veterans can now receive additional allowance for dependents**. At 30%, if the vet has a spouse, children, or dependent parents, their monthly VA pay increases for each dependent.
  * **Property Tax Exemption:** Increases proportionally. A 30% disabled Utah veteran can exempt **30% of \$505,548** of primary residence value – roughly **\$151,664** of value is tax-free. This could eliminate a significant portion of property tax (for example, if their home’s taxable value is \$300,000, about half of it would be exempt). *Note:* The veteran should inform their county if their rating went from 10% to 30% to adjust the exemption percentage. No need to re-file a new application unless the VA percentage changed (the county may just need the updated VA letter).
  * **Vehicle Tax:** Likewise, the available exemption for vehicle property tax increases. A 30% vet could apply up to \~30% of the max credit to offset their vehicle’s age-based tax if not used on a home. This often means they pay zero county tax on one or more vehicles, depending on value.
  * **Travel Reimbursement:** Veterans rated **30% or higher** are eligible for **VA travel pay reimbursement for all VA healthcare appointments, regardless of condition**. This means the VA will pay mileage (at \$0.415/mile in 2025) for travel to VA medical centers or clinics for any treatment. (At 10%, reimbursement was only for appointments related to the SC condition or if low-income.) This can be claimed through the Beneficiary Travel office or an online system after each visit.
  * **Concurrent Receipt:** If the vet is a military retiree, now at 30% they still do **not** qualify for full concurrent retirement (needs 50%), but they are closer. However, if any portion of their disability is combat-related, they could apply for **Combat-Related Special Compensation** (CRSC) which can restore some retired pay for those disabilities at any rating.

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * **Hunting & Fishing Licenses:** Now eligible. Utah resident veterans with **≥20% VA disability** qualify for deeply discounted hunting and fishing licenses. At 30%, the vet can get:

    * Fishing license for **\$12** (versus \~\$34 regular)
    * Hunting license for **\$25.50** (vs. \$38 regular)
    * Combined (fish + hunt) for **\$28.50**.
      To get this, they must provide a VA disability letter (showing ≥20%) to a Utah Division of Wildlife office or online. Once approved initially, they do **not need to reapply each year** – they can renew at the discounted rate automatically.
  * **Utah State Parks Honor Pass:** Still valid (any rating). The vet should renew it each year with updated VA documentation.
  * **Utah Disabled Veteran Plate:** Still eligible (no change except perhaps pride in higher rating).
  * **Local Discounts:** Some county services consider ≥30% as “disabled veteran” for discounts. For example, Salt Lake County has a program where vets 30%+ get discounts on certain county facility fees (one should inquire with county recreation programs or zoos/museums). Check with Hill AFB Outdoor Recreation – sometimes they offer special rates for DAVs on equipment rentals or outdoor adventure trips.

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Dependent Education Assistance:** Not yet (requires 100% P\&T). However, if the veteran’s 30% rating is *permanent* (unlikely at 30), their spouse could possibly use Fry Scholarship if the vet dies of service-connection, etc. For now, no DEA.
  * **State Tuition Waivers:** No new ones at 30% beyond those already mentioned. The vet can still use GI Bill or Voc Rehab. If the 30% rating is a result of a Purple Heart injury, they already have the Purple Heart waiver as well.
  * **Veteran Hiring/Training Programs:** With 30% disability, vets may get priority for certain training programs. For instance, Department of Labor programs (like VRRAP or apprenticeships) often prioritize disabled vets.
  * **Tutoring under Chapter 31:** If using VR\&E, the veteran can get **free tutoring and remedial training** paid by VA, which can be crucial if their disability affects learning.

* **Free/Reduced Services:**

  * **VA Healthcare:** At **30%**, the veteran moves up to **Priority Group 2** for VA healthcare (typically, PG2 is 30-40% SC). This means **no co-pay for outpatient medical appointments related to any condition** (VA waives primary care and specialty care co-pays for PG2 vets) and lower medication co-pays. VA dental is still not entitled (needs 100%).
  * **Medical Equipment:** If the 30% includes mobility impairments, the VA can provide durable medical equipment (wheelchairs, prosthetics, etc.) for service-connected needs. Even if not, any SC condition that requires an assistive device (e.g. knee brace, CPAP for SC sleep apnea) will be provided free.
  * **Caregiver Program:** Veterans who have serious injuries rated 70%+ or TBI/PTSD can get into the VA Comprehensive Caregiver program. At 30%, the veteran likely doesn’t qualify yet unless combined with other factors. But they can use general caregiver support services from VA (training, respite).
  * **Community Healthcare:** Utah has a VA Caregiver Support Center and the Salt Lake VA partners with local agencies for homemaker/home health aide services if the vet needs help at home (usually for higher ratings).
  * **Legal:** All previous legal aid applies. Additionally, a 30% disabled vet may receive *priority* at free legal clinics since many programs triage by those most in need.

* **Housing:**

  * **Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grants:** 30% is not high enough for SAH (those require loss of use of limbs, blindness, etc.). However, if the 30% includes loss of a foot or ankylosis of knees/hips, the vet might qualify for the smaller SHA grant (adaptive housing) – but that’s uncommon at 30%.
  * **Homelessness Prevention:** With higher disability income, the vet might be less likely to face homelessness, but if they do, programs like **HUD-VASH** (housing vouchers for homeless vets) are available regardless of rating. Also, the VA and Utah have an **Emergency Financial Assistance** fund for veterans – at 30%, if struggling, the veteran can seek one-time help from UDVMA or local veteran charities for rent, utilities, etc.
  * **Mortgage-Free Home Programs:** Some nonprofits (Building Homes for Heroes, etc.) focus on 100% disabled vets, but occasionally vets ≥30% can apply for Habitat for Humanity or other assistance with housing modifications.

* **Employment:**

  * **Federal Employment:** A **30% or higher** service-connected veteran has special federal job considerations. Agencies can directly hire them under the **30% Disabled Veteran Authority** without competition. This is separate from Schedule A and is a valuable route to federal employment – the vet can contact agency HR directly citing this authority.
  * **State Employment:** No additional state points beyond being a “disabled veteran,” which the vet already was at 10%. But the vet’s spouse continues to have preference eligibility too (important if the vet is unable to work, the spouse might get hiring preference).
  * **Vocational Rehab:** At 30%, if not already using VR\&E, the vet should strongly consider it for education/career change, as 30% clearly establishes an employment handicap in many cases. VR\&E might provide an extended period of eligibility (beyond the standard 12 years post-discharge) if the vet has a serious employment handicap.
  * **Disabled Veteran Outreach (DVOP):** With a 30% rating, the vet qualifies as having a significant barrier to employment, so DVOP specialists at Utah Department of Workforce Services will actively case-manage them for jobs and training opportunities.
  * **Ticket to Work:** If the veteran is also on Social Security Disability (possible at 30% if unable to work), they can use the Ticket to Work program. If not, the VA’s VR\&E is the main resource as mentioned.

* **Healthcare:**

  * **CHAMPVA for Family:** Not until 100%. At 30%, the veteran’s spouse/kids are not eligible for CHAMPVA (which covers healthcare for dependents of 100% vets). They would need their own insurance or TRICARE (if the vet is also a military retiree).
  * **Local VA Clinics:** The 30% vet might get seen more frequently at the **Ogden VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic** for routine care instead of traveling to Salt Lake. With travel pay reimbursed now, distance is less of a financial barrier.
  * **Mental Health:** If the 30% includes PTSD or mental conditions, the vet is eligible for specialized PTSD programs at VA (e.g. the PTSD Clinical Team at SLC VA). They might also be eligible for in-patient treatment programs for PTSD or substance abuse if needed, with priority given to service-connected vets.
  * **Dental:** Still generally not eligible, but **if the veteran is actively in a VA Vocational Rehab program, they can receive VA dental care** during that program (a little-known benefit).

* **License/Vehicle/Travel:**

  * **Handicapped Parking Placard:** If the veteran’s condition warrants (e.g. limited mobility, breathing issues), they can have a doctor complete Utah Form TC-842 to get a disabled parking placard or a wheelchair symbol on their plate. The VA can assist by documenting any mobility impairment even if the rating is for orthopedic issues.
  * **Vehicle Registration:** The veteran’s property tax exemption can now offset more of the vehicle’s tax. For example, if the vet doesn’t own a home and is 30% SC, they could apply the entire 30% credit (around \$151k of value) across their vehicles. Practically, this means *most if not all* of the annual personal property tax (age-based fees) on their cars, boats, trailers, etc., would be free. They need to coordinate with the county auditor for a form to give the DMV at renewal.
  * **Military Base:** Same commissary/MWR privileges. At 30%, the veteran can also access **recreation areas on base** – e.g. Hill AFB has an FamCamp (campground) that veterans with base access can use. Also, the Information Tickets & Travel (ITT) office on base sells discounted attraction tickets (Disneyland, sports events) to eligible patrons, including disabled vets.
  * **Space-A Travel:** Not yet (see 100%).
  * **Air Travel:** When flying commercial, the vet can use TSA’s military/DoD ID check line by showing the VHIC or military ID (if retired) – this can expedite security. Some airlines also offer free checked bags for veterans; policies vary, but showing VA disability documentation might help on e.g. Southwest or Delta (they often extend courtesy to disabled vets).

* **Local Programs:**

  * **Adaptive Recreation:** Now that the veteran has an established disability, they can join local adaptive sports leagues. For instance, **Ogden’s VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic** may have info on skiing/snowboarding clinics at Snowbasin for disabled veterans, or the Wasatch Adaptive Sports program (which offers discounted or free adaptive ski lessons to vets).
  * **Support Groups:** The veteran can connect with Northern Utah support groups specifically for disabled veterans. The VFW post in Ogden and American Legion in Layton have periodic gatherings for vets with disabilities to share info and camaraderie.
  * **Veterans Service Organizations:** At 30%, the veteran might consider joining groups like Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Chapter 14 in Clearfield/Davis County. DAV offers free assistance with VA claims (they can help if the vet wants to file for an increase) and can connect the vet with transportation programs (some DAV chapters provide free rides to VA appointments for disabled vets who can’t drive).
  * **County Services:** Davis and Weber Counties sometimes have small emergency relief funds for veterans (for things like emergency home repairs or wheelchair ramps). A 30% disabled vet with need might qualify – these are case-by-case and often handled by local veteran committees or the county VA coordinator.

## 50% Disability Rating

A 50% VA disability rating is a significant milestone. The veteran’s monthly VA compensation is much higher, and important new benefits become available (especially regarding healthcare and tax relief). **All benefits at 30% and below apply**; the following highlights what is new or improved at 50%:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Compensation & Dependents:** At 50%, the veteran’s base VA compensation is over \$1,000 per month (about \$1,075 in 2024 for single), plus additional for each dependent. For example, a 50% veteran with a spouse might receive around \$1,190+ monthly. This steady income can help with loan eligibility and financial stability.
  * **Property Tax Exemption:** Jumps to **50% of the maximum \$505,548** in home value exempt. That’s up to **\$252,774 of home value** tax-free. In many Utah counties, this can wipe out property taxes on a modest home. For instance, if a home is worth \$300k, the first \~\$252k is exempt and the vet only pays taxes on \~\$48k – essentially a token amount. If the home is more expensive, the vet saves the full allowed amount. *Note:* If the veteran has both a home and vehicles, they can split the benefit – e.g. use most of it on the home and apply any remainder to vehicle taxes, as long as the total doesn’t exceed their entitled amount.
  * **No Income Tax on VA Comp:** Still tax-free. Additionally, Utah’s **military retirement pay tax credit** is fully applicable if the vet is a military retiree (which many 50% vets might be). So a retired vet with 50% gets **full military pension (state tax-free)** plus VA comp on top (federally tax-free).
  * **Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP):** This is huge for military retirees: **At 50% VA rating, a military retiree’s VA compensation no longer offsets their military retired pay.** They can receive both in full (CRDP). For example, a 20-year retired Master Sergeant with 50% VA would now get their full pension **and** their full VA disability check, substantially boosting income. (CRDP is automatic – DFAS will restore the retired pay).
  * **VA Travel Reimbursement:** Continues (from 30%). Now with 50%, travel pay covers all appointments. Given the veteran likely has more frequent medical visits at this rating, this benefit helps cover gas or lodging if traveling far (mileage + possible per diem for very distant specialized care).
  * **Clothing Allowance:** If the veteran wears a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (knee brace, back brace, etc.) or uses a wheelchair due to a service condition that tends to tear or wear out clothing, the VA provides an annual **clothing allowance** (\~\$945/year). Many 50% vets qualify, especially if they have knee or ankle disabilities requiring braces.

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * **Utah State Parks:** Honor Pass remains available (renew yearly). In practice, a 50% disabled vet can use state parks even more easily, perhaps in conjunction with an Access Pass for federal lands (for camping discounts).
  * **Hunting/Fishing:** The vet already had the discounted licenses (20%+). At 50%, the cost is the same discounted rate. However, **some states** give free licenses at 50% or 100% – Utah doesn’t; it stays at the set discount. Still, the vet should take advantage of the low \$12 fishing license each year.
  * **Local Recreation:** Some counties or cities might offer **free entry to municipal pools or gyms** for higher disabled ratings. It’s worth asking: e.g. a 50% DAV might get a free or \$10/year membership at a city rec center that offers senior/disabled rates. (Policies vary by city.)
  * **Event Discounts:** At 50%, the veteran may qualify for deeper discounts at certain events. For example, the Utah Jazz and Salt Lake Bees often offer special discounted tickets or even occasional free game nights for disabled vets in partnership with veteran groups. Check with MWR or veterans organizations for tickets.

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Chapter 35 DEA (Dependents’ Education Assistance):** Not yet (needs 100% P\&T).
  * **Transfer of GI Bill:** If the veteran is still in service or recently separated 50% disabled, note that transferring GI Bill to dependents required service commitments – if not already done, this may not apply after leaving service.
  * **State Scholarships:** While Utah doesn’t have a specific scholarship for children of disabled veterans (unless the vet is 100% or deceased), a 50% vet’s family should look into national scholarships (American Legion, VFW, etc., often have programs for children of disabled vets).
  * **Voc Rehab Education:** If not already used, VR\&E can still fund further education. At 50%, the veteran might even be mid-career and decide to use VR\&E for a new degree or certification that accommodates their disabilities.

* **Free/Reduced Services:**

  * **VA Healthcare (No Copays):** **VA medical care becomes free for virtually all services at 50%**. Veterans **rated 50% or higher have all VA outpatient care and medications at no charge**. They are placed in **Priority Group 1** for healthcare. This means no co-pays for doctor visits, labs, or prescriptions from the VA pharmacy. This is a major benefit – for example, expensive medications for diabetes, heart conditions, etc., are free.
  * **Dental Care (VA):** A veteran who is **50% or more service-connected is eligible for VA Dental care for *any* dental condition** (not just service-connected ones) as a one-time benefit. Actually, VA regulations grant dental eligibility specifically at 100% or if dental issues are SC. However, in practice, some VA facilities treat 50%+ as eligible for routine dental – this can vary, so it’s best to check with the VA dental clinic. (The formal rule is 100%, but 50% vets often get at least an initial dental exam or emergency care.)
  * **Adaptive Automobile Equipment:** If the veteran’s disabilities affect driving (e.g. loss of foot, limited leg mobility), the VA can provide adaptive automobile equipment or modifications. There’s also a one-time **automobile grant** (\$24K+) for certain severe disabilities (like loss of limbs or severe joint immobility) – more likely at higher ratings, but worth knowing.
  * **Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) Grant:** A veteran with any service-connected disability can get a HISA grant for home modifications (up to \$6,800 for SC vets) to improve accessibility (wider doors, ramps, handrails). At 50%, if the vet has trouble with stairs or bathing due to SC conditions, they should apply for HISA through the VA prosthetics department.
  * **Caregiver Support:** If the veteran’s condition has worsened such that they need assistance at home, they may now qualify for the **VA Comprehensive Caregiver Program** (which was expanded to vets of all eras with serious service-connected disabilities). Typically one qualifying criteria is 70%+, but need for caregiver is the main factor. If the vet does qualify, their caregiver (often a spouse) could receive a stipend and training.
  * **Mental Health:** A 50% rating often means the vet might have PTSD, TBI, or other serious mental health issues rated in that. They have full access to VA Mental Health services with no copays now. The vet might consider inpatient PTSD programs (e.g. the 7-week PTSD program at VA SLC) or Polytrauma System of Care if TBI – all free at this rating.
  * **Local Clinics & Programs:** The vet may be eligible for Utah state programs for people with disabilities, such as vocational rehab (state) services or independent living centers, irrespective of veteran status. Being a disabled vet opens many doors – e.g., the Ability 1st Utah or TRI-County Independent Living Center can assist with home adaptations beyond what VA does.

* **Housing:**

  * **Specially Adapted Housing Grants:** Perhaps still not applicable unless the 50% includes very specific disabilities (like blindness or loss of both feet etc.). But if the vet’s disabilities are primarily orthopedic and rated 50%, they likely don’t qualify for the SAH grant yet.
  * **Property Tax Relief (Recap):** The veteran should *definitely* be taking advantage of the property tax abatement now. If they haven’t applied before, apply by Sept 1 with the VA 50% letter. If they’ve been getting it at a lower rate, ensure the county adjusts it to 50%. This relief can also apply to a **surviving spouse** if the vet passes – important to note for family planning.
  * **Housing Assistance:** If the veteran is unable to work (which could be at 50% or higher), they may qualify for certain subsidized housing sooner. HUD-VASH vouchers (for subsidized housing with case management) generally target homeless vets with high needs, but a veteran struggling to afford housing on disability alone can seek help from the VA homeless program even if not literally homeless (prevention).
  * **Utah Veteran Homes:** If the veteran (or spouse) ever needs long-term care, being 50% might give some priority and also VA will pay a larger portion of the cost in a state veterans home. Specifically, if a vet is 70% or more, VA can pay the full cost of a state veteran nursing home. At 50%, they’d pay a daily care rate (significantly subsidized by VA).
  * **Homestead Exemption Equivalent:** Some states fully exempt 100% disabled vets from property tax; Utah’s partial exemption is the approach here. At 50%, the Utah vet is getting roughly half off property taxes, which is one of the better deals nationwide (though not as good as full exemption at 100%).

* **Employment:**

  * **Unemployability Consideration:** At 50%, if the veteran cannot maintain employment due to service-connected conditions, they might consider applying for **Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU)**. TDIU allows the VA to pay them at the 100% rate if their disabilities (50% or combined 50%+) prevent gainful employment. Generally, one needs at least one disability at 60% or a combined 70% with one at 40% for schedular TDIU, but even at 50% combined, one can seek extra-schedular TDIU in special cases. If the veteran’s 50% is a single condition and they can’t work because of it, this is an avenue to explore with a VSO.
  * **Vocational Rehabilitation:** If not used yet, VR\&E eligibility is typically good for 12 years after discharge or until fully rehabbed. At 50%, the vet likely has used or is using it, but if not, they should contact VR\&E. If 50% and unemployed, they have a “serious employment handicap,” which usually means VR\&E can extend services past the normal time limit.
  * **Federal Jobs:** The veteran still has 10-point preference, Schedule A, and 30%+ hiring authority. Some federal jobs specifically note “This position is open to 30% or more disabled veterans” – so at 50% the vet can fully leverage that. They should also use **USAJOBS “veterans” filter** and consider connecting with a VA Vocational Rehabilitation counselor who can assist in federal job placement.
  * **State Jobs:** Utah state government may have specific roles for which disabled veterans get absolute preference if minimally qualified. It’s worth checking with the Utah Department of Human Resource Management if any fast-track hiring for disabled vets exists (some states allow bypassing exams for vets with certain ratings).
  * **Small Business Preference:** If entrepreneurship is in view, at 50% the vet can certify as a **Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)** for federal contracting. While not state-specific, this can give an edge in obtaining contracts.

* **Healthcare:**

  * **Vision and Dental Insurance (FEDVIP):** Unrelated to VA but worth noting – if the vet is a military retiree or federal employee, they might have separate options. But since VA covers medical and possibly some dental needs, the veteran might not need private insurance for those at 50%.
  * **CHAMPVA:** Still not for spouse/kids until 100%. If the veteran is unable to work and spouse is low-income, the family might use Medicaid or ACA plans for the dependents’ healthcare.
  * **Care at Hill AFB Clinic:** If the veteran is a retiree or dependent, they could still use the base clinic. But if not, the VA is their primary. Some 50% vets get permission to see community care doctors through the VA’s Community Care program (if VA wait times are long or distance is far), so they may actually go to civilian doctors paid for by VA. At 50%, they meet criteria if VA can’t provide timely specialty care.

* **License/Vehicle/Travel:**

  * **Free Drivers License:** Some states waive driver license fees for disabled vets (e.g. Florida at 100%). Utah does not waive the standard license fee at 50%; however, Utah DPS may provide an ID card or license with veteran designation at reduced cost if the veteran is indigent/elderly (case by case).
  * **Vehicle Registration:** The vet can now basically eliminate the county portion of registration on most vehicles using their exemption. They should do the paperwork each year or ask if the county can carry it over. Weber County’s guidance says once approved, you don’t reapply unless changes, but you **do** have to inform the county each year how to allocate the exemption (home vs vehicles).
  * **Disabled Parking:** If the 50% includes conditions that limit mobility (e.g. knee/spine issues), the veteran should absolutely get a disabled parking placard. Even though the DV plate itself isn’t a handicap placard, the veteran can request the wheelchair symbol on a DV plate with proper medical certification, combining both. This allows parking in handicap spots. It can be very helpful at busy base facilities or VA hospitals (free valet parking is also available at the VA hospital for disabled vets).
  * **Military Base Privileges:** At 50%, in addition to commissary/Exchange, note that **MWR** facilities like base gyms are generally open to all with base access. The Hill AFB gym is usually active-duty/retiree only, but since 2020, many bases have extended gym use to 100% disabled vets. It’s a bit unclear at 50% – often the DoD ID (for 100%) or VHIC (for any SC) doesn’t grant gym or swimming pool access unless escorted. However, things like base bowling alley, outdoor recreation rentals, and hobby shops are usually MWR and **are** open to all eligible veterans per the 2020 law. (Check each facility – e.g. Hill AFB might allow VHIC holders to use the Auto Hobby shop, but not the Fitness Center.)
  * **Space-A Travel:** Not yet (100% P\&T required by law).
  * **Travel/Leisure:** A 50% vet might receive offers from charities like Vacations for Veterans (which provides free resort stays to disabled vets). Also, groups like Wounded Warriors sometimes sponsor sports event trips for 50%+ vets. It’s worth joining mailing lists for reputable veteran nonprofits for such opportunities.

* **Local Programs:**

  * **Hill AFB Area Support:** Hill AFB’s Airman & Family Readiness Center often includes veterans in some workshops (like resume writing, transitioning, etc.). As a 50% vet, if you’re a retiree or dependent, you likely already tapped these, but even if not, you can reach out for resources.
  * **Utah DAV Transportation Network:** In Utah, DAV volunteers provide free rides to VA medical appointments for veterans who can’t drive (due to disability). A 50% vet who, say, can’t drive long distances because of medication or condition can call the DAV Transportation Office at the VA to schedule rides.
  * **Community Recognition:** Some Utah cities honor local disabled veterans at events (e.g. Ogden’s Veterans Day ceremony often highlights a “Disabled Veteran of the Year”). While this isn’t a material benefit, it shows community support.
  * **Peer Mentoring:** The 50% veteran can also become a mentor to other vets. Programs like Team Rubicon (disaster response) and Mission Continues welcome disabled vets to serve in adapted capacities, which can be rewarding.

## 80% Disability Rating

An 80% VA disability rating indicates a very significant level of disability (or combination of disabilities). The veteran is likely dealing with serious health issues but is not yet at 100%. Benefits largely mirror those at 70% and 90%, but we’ll outline all available benefits. **All benefits from lower ratings apply**; key points at 80% include maximizing existing benefits and inching closer to 100% perks:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Compensation:** At 80%, the veteran’s 2024 VA compensation is about **\$1,995 per month (single)**, plus dependents. For example, with a spouse it’s around \$2,161. This is a substantial tax-free income. Many 80% vets may also be on SSDI (if unable to work). Note that VA comp does not reduce SSDI – they can receive both.
  * **Property Tax Exemption:** Up to **80% of \$505,548** home value is exempt, which is about **\$404,438** of value. In practical terms, an 80% disabled vet will pay almost no property tax unless they own a high-value home. For instance, if their home is worth \$400k taxable, an 80% exemption would cover \~\$404k – effectively **zero property tax due**. If the home is more (say \$500k), they’d only be taxed on the remaining \$96k. This benefit cannot exceed the cap (which is \$505,548), so even a million-dollar home gets max \$505k off. The veteran should double-check that they’re receiving the full updated exemption amount each year (the legislature can adjust the cap – it used to be \~\$275k years ago and is \$505k as of 2023).
  * **Vehicle Taxes:** With 80%, the veteran likely uses the exemption fully on their home. But if not (or if they rent and have no home), that 80% credit can go a long way on personal property. Essentially, the vet could register multiple vehicles, boats, etc., and not pay the county tax on them until the aggregated value exceeds \~\$404k. In short, *all* their personal-use vehicles probably have their age-based fees waived.
  * **Concurrent Receipt:** Already in effect if retired (50%+). If the veteran is a Chapter 61 medically retired veteran (with less than 20 years), note that CRDP doesn’t apply to Chapter 61 retirees – they need CRSC. At 80%, if the disabilities are combat-related, they should absolutely apply for CRSC through their branch, as CRSC could pay a portion of what CRDP does not (since CRDP covers 20-year retirees only).
  * **TDIU Consideration:** If the veteran is not working, **Individual Unemployability** is a key consideration at 80%. The schedular criteria for TDIU (one disability 60%+ or combined 70%+ with one 40%+) is met, so the vet can apply for TDIU if their disabilities prevent substantially gainful employment. If granted, TDIU would pay them at the 100% rate and be treated much like 100% for certain benefits (often including state benefits like property tax – but Utah’s is explicitly by percentage, so TDIU doesn’t change the percentage, though it might help in other areas like commissary which the vet already has).
  * **Special Monthly Compensation (SMC):** The veteran might start qualifying for SMC at 80% if they have specific severe disabilities. For example, loss of use of a limb, or if one disability is rated 100% and others combine to 60% (SMC “S” housebound). At 80% combined, perhaps not yet, but if they have one 100% plus others, they’d be beyond 80. However, check if any single disability is rated 50% or higher and causes issues like loss of use – e.g.,  loss of use of a foot qualifies for SMC-K (\$128 extra). So an 80% vet with, say, an amputated leg (60%) and other conditions 20% might be 80% combined but also get SMC for the limb.

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * **Utah State Parks:** No change; still free with Honor Pass. The vet likely uses this heavily for recreation/therapy.
  * **Hunting/Fishing:** Still at the discounted rate. Perhaps consider a **disabled veteran lifetime fishing license** – Utah doesn’t explicitly have one, but some states do. Utah does a year at a time. The vet just needs to renew annually at the discount. (At this point, the cost is negligible, but it’s more about the convenience.)
  * **Free Camping:** Utah State Parks Honor Pass covers day-use, not camping fees. However, **America the Beautiful Access Pass** (the national parks pass for disabled) gives *50% off* federal campground fees. Also, some Utah STATE parks offer discounts on camping for disabled vets (policy not uniform, but the Honor Pass doesn’t waive camping). The veteran should ask at park check-in if any discount – some rangers will waive fees for a disabled vet, even if policy doesn’t require it.
  * **Local Benefits:** At certain high disability levels, some states issue a **Disabled Veteran ID card**. Utah doesn’t have a statewide one beyond the driver license indicator and VA/DOD IDs. But county veteran service offices may provide something acknowledging the vet’s 80% status for local benefits. For example, the vet could be eligible for property tax abatements on business personal property if they run a small business (some counties might consider waiving those if the vet is disabled – this is not common but worth inquiring if relevant).

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Dependents’ Education:** If the veteran hasn’t gotten to 100% P\&T, their dependents don’t have DEA/Chapter35 yet. However, if the veteran is **80% and unemployable** (if they apply and get TDIU P\&T), then dependents would get DEA. Short of that, no direct new benefit.
  * **State Dependent Tuition:** Utah does **not** have free tuition for children of 80% or even 100% disabled vets (only for fallen service members via the Scott Lundell waiver). So at 80%, the vet’s kids don’t automatically get waivers. Plan for college using VA Chapter 35 if vet goes 100%, or transfer of GI Bill if that was done while in service.
  * **Retraining (VR\&E):** If the veteran can possibly work in some capacity, VR\&E can still assist with independent living services. Actually, VR\&E has a track called **Independent Living (IL)** for veterans who cannot work but need help to live more independently – often offered to vets with 60%+ and severe impairments. At 80%, if the vet can’t use employment services, they might be a candidate for IL support (home adaptations, organizing community support, etc.).
  * **Scholarships:** There are private scholarships specifically for children/spouses of disabled veterans (e.g., Freedom Alliance). At 80%, it’s worth exploring these as the vet’s family might qualify because of the high disability percentage.

* **Free/Reduced Services:**

  * **VA Healthcare:** Still Priority Group 1 (same as 50%+). All VA medical care and prescriptions remain free. The veteran likely uses numerous services: primary care, specialty clinics, prosthetics, etc., with \$0 cost.
  * **Dental Care:** **If the veteran is rated 100% *temporary*** (like convalescent) or TDIU P\&T, then dental would start. But at 80% schedular, comprehensive VA dental is *technically* not a guaranteed benefit. However, given their high rating, the VA may provide some dental on a case-by-case basis (especially if dental issues aggravate medical conditions). It’s worth a try to ask the VA dental clinic for an evaluation – sometimes they will treat significant dental issues for veterans with high disability levels as a clinical decision.
  * **Caregiver Program:** If not already, the veteran’s condition at 80% might qualify for the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers if they need help with activities of daily living or protection from hazards due to service conditions. E.g., a vet with 80% including a serious TBI, PTSD, or ALS could have their spouse as a paid caregiver under this program.
  * **Respite Care:** The VA can provide **respite care** for caregivers of veterans with significant disabilities. At 80%, the vet or family can request a certain number of hours/days of in-home care services or short nursing home stays to give the primary caregiver a break.
  * **Veteran-Service Dog:** If the veteran’s 80% includes PTSD, hearing loss, or mobility issues, they might qualify for a service dog through organizations like Labs for Liberty (Utah-based) or others. The VA itself will support guide dogs and some service dogs (for blind or mobility-impaired vets, and in some cases PTSD dogs) by covering vet care. This can greatly improve quality of life.
  * **Special Rehabilitation Programs:** The Salt Lake City VA and others have Polytrauma rehabilitation for those with multiple severe injuries. An 80% vet could take part in **therapeutic programs** – e.g., music therapy, art therapy, equine therapy (some offered via VA or community partnerships). These can be free or low cost.
  * **Legal/Financial Counseling:** By this stage, the veteran might consider legal tools like establishing a trust or having powers of attorney. Some Utah legal clinics specifically help disabled vets with estate planning at no cost. Also, the VA and UDVMA occasionally hold **financial management seminars** for veterans who are 100% or considering TDIU (how to manage benefits, protect against scams, etc.). At 80%, it’s a good time to educate oneself and family on these topics.

* **Housing:**

  * **SAH/SHA Grants:** Revisit eligibility. If the 80% rating includes any qualifying conditions (like loss of use of one leg *and* one arm, very severe vision loss, or severe burns, etc.), the vet could get a **Special Home Adaptation (SHA) grant** (approx \$22k) or even the full **Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant** (up to \~\$109k). Most 80% vets won’t meet those unless they have specific injuries. But if, for example, the veteran’s 80% is due to things like bilateral knee replacements and a spinal injury, they might not qualify for SAH. If due to blindness in both eyes at 20/200, they *would* qualify for SHA.
  * **Independent Living:** As mentioned, VR\&E’s independent living program can help severely disabled vets with home modifications that SAH might not cover because the vet isn’t technically eligible for SAH. The IL program might fund things like wheelchair ramps, roll-in showers, or specialized equipment at home to allow the vet to live as independently as possible.
  * **Long-Term Care:** If the veteran reaches a point of needing nursing care, at **70% or higher service-connected**, the VA can place the veteran in a community nursing home or state veteran home at **no cost to the veteran** (the VA covers it). So at 80%, the vet has this safety net: VA-paid nursing home care (often this requires the need for that level of care and usually the disability that’s 80% must be a reason for needing nursing care).
  * **Homestead for Surviving Spouse:** The surviving spouse of a veteran who was ≥10% gets the same property tax exemption in Utah. So if the veteran passes, the spouse can continue to claim the 80% exemption each year. If the vet dies of service-connected causes, the spouse can claim a full 100% exemption of property taxes for life. It’s worth ensuring the spouse is aware of this and that paperwork is in order for a seamless transfer of benefits if needed.

* **Employment:**

  * **TDIU vs. Working:** Some 80% disabled veterans are still working, but likely in a limited capacity or in a very accommodating job. Others might not work at all. If the veteran can work, there’s no penalty or reduction in benefits (until 100% if TDIU has been granted, in which case working can jeopardize TDIU). At 80% schedular, they can earn income freely.
  * **Voc Rehab Self-Employment Track:** VR\&E offers a self-employment track for veterans with severe disabilities who might have difficulty working for others. If the vet has an entrepreneurial idea (like a home-based business they can manage despite disabilities), VR\&E can sometimes provide training and even supplies/equipment to start the business. At 80%, they’d likely qualify if they choose that route.
  * **Employment Protections:** Remember, the **Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)** and **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** protect disabled veterans in the workplace. At 80%, if the vet is employed, they can request reasonable accommodations from employers under ADA. Also, federal contractors are encouraged to hire vets – some even have hiring targets for disabled vets (OFCCP guidelines).
  * **Volunteer Opportunities:** If working for pay is not feasible, many 80% vets find purpose in volunteering. Utah’s National Ability Center, VA Hospital volunteer service, or local schools (as mentors) welcome veteran volunteers. The vet can contribute without the stress of employment, and sometimes volunteering leads to stipends or other small benefits (for example, AmeriCorps VISTA positions pay a stipend and can accommodate disabilities).

* **Healthcare:**

  * **All VA Medical:** Still free and priority. The veteran should ensure they are getting **all** the healthcare they need. Sometimes at high ratings, vets focus on their compensation but not on maximizing health services. At 80%, they should be getting annual preventative exams, routine labs, and using VA specialty clinics for any issue (audiology for hearing aids, podiatry, pain management, etc.). It’s all free, so use it.
  * **Medicare and VA:** If the veteran is 65+ or on SSDI for 2+ years (maybe likely if 80% and unemployable), they will have Medicare as well. They can have both VA and Medicare. They should keep Medicare Part A/B as backup for non-VA emergencies or providers. VA is not insurance; it’s a benefit, so having Medicare (and maybe a Medicare Advantage plan that’s vet-friendly) is wise.
  * **Adaptive Sports Medical Support:** The VA often sponsors disabled vets to events like the National Veterans Wheelchair Games or Winter Sports Clinic. An 80% vet might be eligible to be sent to these rehab sports events at VA expense, which include medical support and training in sports like wheelchair basketball, skiing, etc. This can be both fun and therapeutic.
  * **Mental Health & Suicide Prevention:** High disability can come with emotional strains. The vet should be aware of VA’s mental health crisis line (988 then press 1) and local resources. Utah has a high suicide rate in general; the vet’s providers will likely ensure they have a safety plan. There are also support groups at VA for chronic pain, PTSD, etc., which an 80% vet can benefit from if not already engaged.

* **License/Vehicle/Travel:**

  * **Driver License Fee Waiver:** Utah does not explicitly waive driver license fees at 80%. The veteran will still pay the normal renewal fee (unless they have some hardship status).
  * **Parking:** The free SLC Airport parking for DV plates is still available and very useful if the vet travels for leisure or medical flights. At this rating, maybe the vet travels to specialized VA programs or to visit family; they can park free for up to 10 days in economy each trip.
  * **Air Travel:** 80% by itself doesn’t grant Space-A. If the veteran is medically retired from the military at 100% disability equivalent, they might have a DoD ID that allows Space-A (but that’s basically for 100%).
  * **Space-A workaround:** Some veterans who are 80% might also be **Purple Heart recipients** or combat vets, which could make them eligible for certain Space-A categories soon (there have been discussions in Congress about expanding Space-A to more disabled vets, but currently it’s just 100%).
  * **Vehicle Adaptation:** If the veteran needs hand controls or other car modifications due to SC disabilities, the VA will provide those. At 80%, if not done yet, they should ask VA Driver Rehabilitation programs. Also, Utah DMV offers a **disabled veteran wheelchair logo decal** that can be added to the DV plate if the vet qualifies for accessible parking (combining benefits).
  * **Rest Areas & State Facilities:** Some states offer free tolls or rest area parking for disabled vets. Utah has no toll roads except express lanes, which do not have a vet exemption as of now. But the DV plate can sometimes let you use HOV lanes if you have the purple heart or disability insignia (in Utah, HOV exceptions are only for vehicles with “C” decals or if you pay).
  * **Utah Transit:** If the vet hasn’t gotten the UTA reduced fare card yet, by 80% they certainly qualify. This gives them huge discounts if they ever use buses or TRAX (e.g., \$1 fare instead of \$2.50, \$2/day cap). Even if they mostly drive, it’s good to have in case they can’t drive temporarily.
  * **Recreation Travel:** There are charitable organizations that provide hunting or fishing trips for disabled vets (like hunts for veterans with disabilities often offered by groups in Utah/Wyoming). At 80%, the vet could partake in these free outings where volunteers assist. The state DWR sometimes partners with groups for dedicated disabled vet hunting tags or events.

* **Local Programs:**

  * **County VA Reps:** The vet likely is well-known to their county veterans service officer by now. These reps can help ensure the vet is receiving all benefits. For example, **Weber County’s veteran service** might help the vet apply for TDIU or SMC if appropriate. They also connect vets to any county initiatives (like Weber County’s “Veterans Advisory Committee” which might have small grants or assistance).
  * **Community Nursing Services:** Utah has community nursing services that can come to a veteran’s home (home health). The VA can contract with them for things like physical therapy at home or skilled nursing visits. At 80%, if the vet can’t easily get out, the VA can arrange some at-home services through community care.
  * **Support for Family:** The impact on the family is big at 80%. Utah’s Department of Veterans & Military Affairs has a **Spouse and Family Program** that provides information on counseling (including free counseling through Vet Centers for family members of combat vets) and support groups for caregivers. The veteran’s spouse or caregiver in Davis/Weber might join a caregiver support group (some are run by the VA, others by organizations like Red Cross Military Veteran Caregiver Network).
  * **Veterans Clubs:** Many local veteran clubs (American Legion, DAV, VFW) essentially roll out the red carpet for an 80% disabled vet. They can provide camaraderie, and often these organizations raise funds that can directly help a needy veteran (for example, paying a utility bill or providing groceries during hardships). The vet should not hesitate to lean on these networks if times are tough.
  * **Recreational Therapy in Community:** Beyond official programs, just being identified as a disabled vet in the community can open doors. For instance, a local golf course might let the vet golf for free on certain days (especially if the vet is part of a VA golf therapy program). There are also community gardens and equine therapy farms in Utah that give preference to disabled vets. The VA hospital’s recreational therapy dept. can connect the vet to these.

## 90% Disability Rating

A 90% VA disability rating is very high (only one step below total). Often it means the veteran has multiple serious disabilities. The difference between 80% and 90% in benefits is not dramatic (most benefits have already kicked in by 50% or 100%), but the monetary compensation is higher and it’s easier to qualify for TDIU. We outline all benefits at this level. **All benefits from 80% apply**; additionally:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Compensation:** At 90%, the veteran’s VA compensation is roughly **\$2,197 per month (single)**; with a spouse that’s about \$2,354 (and more for each child). This is a significant sum, effectively a full-time wage in Utah, and it’s tax-free.
  * **Property Tax Exemption:** Now **90% of \$505,548** is exempt. That equals up to **\$455,0**<span style="white-space:nowrap">\*\*\*\* (approx)\*\* which covers most homes. In fact, for any home valued at \$505k or less, a 90% disabled vet will pay tax on only 10% of it. For example, a \$400,000 home – 90% exemption covers \$364k, leaving \$36k taxable (which might be maybe \~\$400 of tax). If the home is exactly \$505,548, the vet pays tax on about \$50.5k of it (10%). This is almost a full waiver.
  * **Use of Exemption:** As always, the vet can split between home and personal property. At 90%, practically the entire value of one home *and* one or more vehicles can be tax-free. E.g., they could cover a \$400k house and still have \~\$55k exemption left for vehicles, etc. It’s important they coordinate with the county to allocate it optimally (usually primary residence first, remainder to vehicles).
  * **TDIU vs 90%:** Many vets at 90% pursue Individual Unemployability to get paid at 100%. If the VA grants **TDIU (and it’s permanent)**, the veteran’s pay jumps to 100% rate and they gain some of the ancillary benefits of 100%. It’s worth noting here because some Utah state benefits (like the property tax) are explicitly by percentage and likely would still treat a TDIU 90% vet as 90%. But others, like the free national park pass (federal) or base access (already have), remain unchanged. The big one is CHAMPVA and DEA for dependents – those kick in only if the VA deems the veteran **100% permanent**. TDIU can be considered permanent total if so labeled. If the vet is 90% and struggling to work, they should apply for TDIU, which is essentially an “upgrade” to full benefits without hitting 100% schedular.
  * **Special Monthly Compensation:** At 90%, if not already receiving any SMC, check again for possible qualifications (like loss of use of an extremity, etc.). No new general financial perks at 90 specifically, but the vet should maximize what they can: e.g., **Aid and Attendance (A\&A)** if they need help with daily activities. A\&A is an additional benefit for vets who are disabled to the point of needing regular aid, and is often considered at 100% but a 90% vet can also be granted A\&A if they have extremely high needs (this usually pushes them to 100%+SMC though).

* **State & County Discounts:**

  * Essentially identical to 80%. Utah does not have any extra perks that start exactly at 90% (the next jump is 100%).
  * The veteran continues to get all the same waivers: state parks, DV plates, hunting/fishing, etc.
  * One thing: with a 90% rating, the veteran might be more visibly recognized by local veteran groups – sometimes county commissions issue **special recognition certificates** to veterans who are 70%+ or 90%+ disabled for their sacrifice. For example, a local American Legion might present the vet with a plaque. (While not a monetary benefit, this can build community connections which can indirectly lead to support or small perks from local businesses.)
  * If the veteran hasn’t already, they should ensure they have the **Utah Honorary Lifetime Fishing License** if available (some states do at high disability; Utah specifically doesn’t advertise lifetime, but the annual renewal is fine).
  * **Utah Disabled Veteran Honor Pass Renewal:** By now, renewing this annually is routine, but just a reminder to keep doing it – an expired pass won’t be honored at the gate.

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Dependents’ Education (Chapter 35 DEA):** If the veteran is **90% P\&T (permanent and total)** – which the VA sometimes grants at 90 if no improvement expected – then *yes*, DEA for spouse and kids becomes available. But if VA hasn’t declared the 90% as “total and permanent,” DEA is not yet available. Many times, VA does not declare P\&T until 100%, but it can at 90 depending on conditions (the award letter will say if the veteran is considered totally and permanently disabled for VA purposes).
  * If P\&T: each child/spouse could get **DEA** (which provides \~\$1,400 per month for schooling) and could use **Chapter 35 CalVet tuition waiver** if in some states (California does, Utah doesn’t have an equivalent).
  * If not P\&T: plan for when the veteran reaches 100% or gets P\&T.
  * **Education for Veteran:** At 90%, if the vet still wants to pursue training, VR\&E might still help, though if it’s long after discharge, VR\&E might have closed their case. The vet could consider using the **Post-9/11 GI Bill for themselves if not used** (some vets hold onto it in case they can use it for a new trade or advanced degree).

* **Free/Reduced Services:**

  * **Healthcare:** Still fully covered by VA with no copays. The veteran likely has numerous medical appointments. They should be aware that at high ratings, the VA can authorize **home-based primary care (HBPC)** – a VA team that comes to the home to provide care for vets who have difficulty traveling. At 90%, if the vet is mostly homebound, they can ask for HBPC.
  * **Adaptive Housing/Auto:** The vet may now have progressed in age or condition to qualify for adaptations even if earlier they didn’t. E.g., maybe now they use a wheelchair or walker. The VA’s HISA and adaptive equipment benefits remain available. If the vet didn’t get an Auto Grant but now, say, has loss of use of a foot, they should apply for it (one-time \~\$22k for a vehicle purchase, plus free vehicle modifications).
  * **In-Home Care:** The VA can provide **homemaker/home health aide services** a few times a week to help with activities (cleaning, cooking, etc.) for veterans who need it due to disability – which a 90% vet might. This is means-tested by need, but likely justified at this rating if the vet has trouble.
  * **Respite & Day Care:** VA also has Adult Day Health Care programs (like at the SLC VA or contracted nursing facilities) where the vet can spend a day with medical supervision and activities, giving the caregiver a break. 90% vets get priority access.
  * **Mental Health:** Continue to use VA mental health. If the veteran’s condition includes psychiatric disability, ensure they are aware of **adaptive sports** and creative arts therapy. At 90%, they might have an opportunity to participate in the **National Veterans Creative Arts Festival** if they engage in art or music therapy, which is a great program (and VA will cover travel if selected).
  * **Legal Services:** By now, hopefully the veteran has any needed legal documents (will, advanced directive). If not, groups like Utah Legal Services or BYU Law’s free clinic often will draft a simple will or advanced medical directive for disabled vets at no cost. The **Utah\@Ease** program can help coordinate that if needed.

* **Housing:**

  * **Maximizing Property Tax:** If the veteran hasn’t bought a home due to tax concerns, at 90% the tax should not deter them. In fact, owning a home is advantageous because they can use that huge exemption. If they rent, they might be missing out – though Utah does have a **renter’s refund** for low-income elderly or disabled, the vet likely has too high an income from VA to qualify for that (income limit is \~\$35k).
  * **SAH Grant:** Re-evaluate again. 90% itself isn’t a qualifier, but maybe conditions changed. For example, if the veteran now requires a wheelchair for mobility, even part-time, they could qualify for housing grants. If not, look ahead: at 100% certain things become easier (like if 100% for ALS or severe injury, SAH is easier to get).
  * **Care Facilities:** The veteran at 90% might consider moving to an assisted living or independent living community if they have trouble maintaining a house. While VA won’t pay for assisted living directly, they do pay Aid & Attendance to help, and state veterans homes sometimes have “domiciliary” units for less care-intensive living. Utah’s Veterans Homes primarily do skilled nursing, but some have a few assisted living beds. Also, the VA has a Medical Foster Home program – matching disabled vets with caregiver families in a home setting – something to explore if institutional living isn’t appealing.
  * **Homelessness:** Unlikely at this stage, but if any risk, the veteran should know that 90% SC would make them a priority for rapid housing. VA Homeless programs would pull out all stops to get a 90% vet into stable housing because of their vulnerability and guaranteed income stream (which actually makes it easier to sustain housing once found).

* **Employment:**

  * **Working at 90%:** Few can, but some do in limited ways. If the veteran is still employed, they probably have strong accommodations or a flexible job (perhaps self-employed or part-time). They should be careful not to jeopardize potential TDIU if they are barely hanging on to a job out of necessity. If financially possible, leaving work and getting TDIU might be better for health.
  * **Protected Work Environment:** If the vet works for a family business or is self-employed with low earnings, they might still get TDIU because that’s not considered “substantially gainful” employment. Something to know if they make below the federal poverty threshold (about \$13k/year), they could likely qualify for TDIU while still doing that minimal work.
  * **Post-Employment Activities:** Many 90% vets focus on volunteer work (as mentioned). At this level, the veteran might become a volunteer VA Hospital peer counselor or DAV service officer helping fellow vets. These roles are often unpaid but can be fulfilling and flexible with health needs.
  * **Social Security Disability:** If the veteran hasn’t already applied for SSDI and cannot work, they should. A VA rating of 90% (especially if one condition is 70%+ or they have a 100% TDIU) often expedites Social Security’s decision – SSA gives great weight to VA findings now. Getting SSDI would add to their income and eventually lead to Medicare coverage.
  * **Protections:** If the veteran is working, all previous notes on ADA apply even more strongly. It might also be prudent to ensure they have filed EEOC disability status with their employer if accommodations are needed.

* **Healthcare:**

  * **CHAMPVA for Dependents:** Not yet, unless TDIU P\&T is granted (or unless they hit 100%). So spouse/kids still need their own coverage or maybe TRICARE if applicable.
  * **Medicare:** Many 90% vets are older or on SSDI, hence on Medicare. Use VA for most things, but Medicare can fill gaps or allow local doctors under the VA Community Care if VA wait is long (with authorization).
  * **Hospice/Palliative Care:** Hopefully not needed, but VA does provide hospice care at no cost when the time comes (for any terminal condition if veteran is enrolled). At 90%, if the veteran’s conditions are life-limiting, they should discuss advanced care planning with VA. Some conditions (like ALS, end-stage organ disease) might prompt palliative care involvement even while still treating.
  * **Preventive Care:** The veteran should continue all preventive screenings (colonoscopy, etc.). The VA will even pay for non-service connected preventive care at this stage because it’s part of overall health maintenance (and free).
  * **Dental:** If still not qualified, consider alternative resources: some dental schools or nonprofits (like Donated Dental Services) offer free/low-cost dental care to disabled or low-income individuals. The veteran’s high VA income might disqualify from charity, but maybe not if expenses are high. Alternatively, if one tooth or issue is aggravating a service condition, sometimes VA can treat it under adjunct conditions.

* **License/Vehicle/Travel:**

  * **No new license perks** at 90% beyond earlier. The DV plate and handicap placard are the main ones. Perhaps ensure the placard is permanent (Utah issues permanent placards for permanent disabilities – likely the vet has that).
  * **Air Travel:** The law currently says **100% P\&T veterans can use Space-A flights** (Category VI, within CONUS and to US territories). At 90%, if not P\&T, the vet can’t yet. If the vet gets TDIU P\&T, then yes, they would count as 100% and could fly Space-A (a nice perk for leisure travel).
  * **If Retired Military:** At 90% the vet likely already had all retiree benefits. One thing to note: at 100%, some retired vets get their DoD ID card reclassified to a DAV category. At 90%, if they’re retired, they still use their standard retiree ID and get full base privileges (commissary, base gym, etc.) anyway by virtue of being a retiree. So nothing new there.
  * **Travel Assistance:** There are groups like Veteran Airlift Command that provide free private flights for combat wounded veterans for medical or other needs. A 90% combat-wounded vet could possibly use that if needing specialized care far away.
  * **Adaptive Driving:** At this point, if not done, the vet should have everything needed to drive safely. If they can’t drive, Utah’s DMV or local transit may offer paratransit services. UTA has a Paratransit for those unable to use regular buses (the vet qualifies if disability prevents normal transit use, regardless of VA rating). Paratransit rides require application but then cost only a few dollars.

* **Local Programs:**

  * **100% Club Preparations:** Some counties in other states have special recognition or life perks for 100% vets; Utah not so much. But at 90%, local VSOs (Veteran Service Orgs) might encourage the vet to push for the last 10%. They will often assist free of charge with filing an increase or TDIU. The vet should take advantage of DAV, VFW, or American Legion service officers in Salt Lake City or regional offices to review their file for any overlooked conditions or secondary conditions that could bump them to 100%. For example, if the vet is 90% combined and, say, has hypertension that was never claimed (secondary to diabetes or PTSD perhaps), claiming it and getting even 10% could push to 92% which rounds to 100. These reps know the drill and can help.
  * **Community Support:** The veteran is likely well integrated into the veteran community by now. If they need something specific (like a wheelchair ramp or home repair), local groups (Home Depot Foundation, Habitat for Humanity’s veteran projects) often step up for highly disabled vets. A 90% vet can reach out through the county VSO to see if any programs can assist with home modifications beyond what VA does.
  * **Veterans Cemetery:** As a reminder, the veteran is eligible for burial at the state veterans cemetery and a plot for their spouse (spouse’s burial has a small fee). At 90%, if the vet unfortunately passes from their service conditions, the spouse would then get DIC (Dependency and Indemnity Compensation) from the VA. DIC is a separate benefit (around \$1,562/mo in 2025) for surviving spouses of vets who died from service-connected issues. Not directly a benefit to the vet at 90, but something their family should know about. It’s wise to make sure next-of-kin know to contact a VSO or VA if the worst happens.
  * **Memorial Benefits:** The veteran can get a free VA headstone or marker and Presidential Memorial Certificate no matter the rating, but at 90% these end-of-life honors might be on one’s mind. Possibly premature, but planning is important.
  * **Councils and Advocacy:** A veteran of this stature (90%) might be invited to serve on advisory councils – e.g., Utah’s Veterans Advisory Council to the legislature. If able, their experience can help shape future benefits. Utah has been known to adjust veteran benefits over time (like increasing the property tax exemption cap), often due to advocacy by veterans. A 90% vet’s voice carries weight in those circles.

## 100% Disability Rating

**100% VA disability** (or Total Disability, including TDIU rated as permanent) is the top tier and unlocks the maximum benefits at both federal and state levels. This includes everything from all lower ratings **plus** some major new benefits for the veteran and their family. We will cover federal benefits, Utah state benefits, and local perks for a fully disabled veteran:

* **Financial & Tax Benefits:**

  * **VA Compensation:** A 100% schedular rating provides roughly **\$3,621 per month** for a single veteran as of 2024 rates. With a spouse, that’s about \$3,823, and additional for each child or dependent parent. This is **tax-free income** for life. If the veteran’s 100% is Permanent & Total (P\&T), these payments will have COLA increases annually and continue with no future exams.
  * **Property Tax Exemption (Utah):** At 100% disability, Utah allows the veteran to exempt **100% of the maximum \$505,548** home value. In effect, up to \$505,548 of their primary residence’s taxable value is **completely tax-free**. If their home is valued at or below that threshold, they owe **\$0 in property taxes** on it. If above, they only pay taxes on the portion above \$505,548. (For example, a \$600k home would be taxed on about \$94.5k of value after the exemption.) This is the largest property tax relief Utah offers and is a huge savings each year. *Note:* The unmarried surviving spouse or minor orphans of a veteran who **dies from service or is KIA** get a full **100% exemption of all property value** with no cap.

    * **Using the Exemption for Vehicles:** The 100% disabled vet can also use the exemption toward personal property like vehicles. With such a large exempt amount, they can essentially **eliminate the county tax on all their personal vehicles, boats, trailers, etc.** If the total value of their vehicles plus home is under \$505,548 (most likely), they pay no property tax on any of it. To do this, they coordinate with the county each year to apply any unused exemption to vehicle registration fees.
  * **Utah State Income Tax:** **VA disability compensation is fully tax-exempt** by state law. Additionally, at 100% a veteran likely isn’t earning other income, but if they have a military pension (or any pension), Utah now provides credits to effectively **exempt military retired pay** from state income tax. So the veteran’s income (VA comp + military pension + Social Security) could be almost entirely tax-free in Utah.
  * **Sales Tax and Fees:** Utah does not waive sales tax for disabled vets generally. However, some localities might waive certain fees (for example, a city business license fee might be waived for a 100% disabled vet running a small home business).
  * **VA Dependency & Indemnity Compensation (DIC):** Not for the veteran, but if the veteran passes from service-connected causes, their spouse is entitled to DIC (currently \~\$1,562 monthly). Because the veteran is 100% P\&T, if they held that rating for 10+ years, their death is presumed service-connected for DIC even if they die of unrelated causes (the **10-year rule**). This provides financial security to the family.
  * **Special Monthly Compensation (SMC):** Many 100% vets also qualify for SMC based on additional needs:

    * **SMC-S (Housebound):** If the vet has one 100% rating and another separate 60% rating, they get an extra housebound payment (around \$384/mo).
    * **SMC-L (Aid & Attendance):** If the veteran needs daily aid of another person (dressing, bathing, feeding, etc.), they might get A\&A which is an additional \~\$800+ per month.
    * **Higher SMC:** For very severe disabilities (loss of limbs, blindness, etc.), SMC rates go up dramatically. For example, a triple amputee or paralyzed veteran can receive multiple thousands extra in SMC. This is case-specific, but worth noting because some 100% vets don’t realize they should be getting more. A Utah vet with extreme disabilities should work with a VSO to ensure all SMC entitlements are claimed.

* **State & Local Tax/Financial Benefits at 100%:**

  * We covered property tax (the big one).
  * **Utah Veteran’s Preference on Property Tax Abatement:** At 100%, the veteran can essentially choose which property to apply it to if they have multiple (for instance, a second home or business equipment—though primary residence is usually the focus). The law says primary residence and non-business personal property. If the vet has, say, a cabin that’s not primary, that might not qualify. The exemption is primarily for primary residence.
  * **Utah Renter’s Credit:** If the 100% vet rents instead of owns, they cannot directly use the property tax exemption (since that’s for owners). However, Utah offers a **Renter’s Refund** for low-income elderly or disabled. A single 100% disabled vet might or might not qualify depending on income (the VA comp might put them over the income limit \~\$40k). But if their income is low, they could get a small refund from the state (up to \~\$1,000). Notably, that program considers “disability” broadly, not specifically service-connected.
  * **Utah Sales Tax Abatements:** There’s no general sales tax exemption for disabled vets, but if the veteran has a VA automobile grant (for a vehicle purchase due to losing limbs/etc.), some states waive auto sales tax. Utah may waive sales tax on vehicles for certain disabled veterans—this would be something to ask the Tax Commission if applicable under the auto grant program (not explicitly stated in common docs, but some vets have sought it).
  * **License Fees:** Utah State Parks Disabled Vet Pass is free (mentioned). **Hunting/Fishing licenses** for a 100% disabled vet might be completely free (some states do that). Utah, as policy, still lists the discounted fee. However, sometimes the Division of Wildlife *may* issue a free lifetime combination license for a 100% P\&T vet as a courtesy (not guaranteed by statute, but anecdotal cases in other states).
  * **Federal Recreation: America the Beautiful Pass:** The veteran qualifies for the **Lifetime Access Pass** which is free (we mentioned it earlier for any disabled, but as 100% P\&T, it’s clear-cut). As of 2022, **all veterans (not just disabled) can get a free annual national parks pass**, but the Access Pass for disabled is lifetime and includes additional discounts (like 50% off camping fees). If they haven’t gotten it yet, do so (it’s available at federal recreation sites with VA letter or VHIC showing disability).

* **State & County Benefits (General/Discounts) at 100%:**

  * **Utah Disabled Veteran License Plate:** The vet can use it as before. *One extra:* At 100%, if the veteran has a permanent total disability, Utah DMV can issue a **disabled person (wheelchair) symbol decal** on the DV plate without yearly doctor certification. Essentially, their VA award letter might suffice to renew the permanent disabled parking status.
  * **Vehicle Registration Fees:** The veteran is exempt from state registration/license plate fees if they have a Purple Heart (that’s a separate criterion). But at 100%, Utah does *not* automatically waive registration fees unless Purple Heart. However, the **age-based property tax** on the vehicle is covered by the exemption as discussed. So effectively, they only pay the small things like emission fees or DMV processing, but no property tax portion and if Purple Heart, no state fee. In short, a 100% disabled Purple Heart vet pays \$0 to register one vehicle.
  * **Utah Driver License:** Utah may provide a **free ID card** to 100% disabled vets if they don’t drive (for example, some states waive ID card fees for senior or disabled – Utah’s fee is low but maybe waived on request). A “veteran” endorsement is already on the license if desired.
  * **State Park Pass:** As before – free annual Honor Pass. Some states give a lifetime park pass for 100% vets; Utah requires annual renewal, but it’s free to renew.
  * **Hunting & Fishing:** Remains discounted (or possibly free if policy changes). The vet can also get special consideration for hunting permits. For example, Utah sometimes allows disabled veterans to get dedicated hunt permits or receive transferred permits. There is also a program where a 100% disabled vet can get a *once-in-a-lifetime* hunting permit opportunity (like a management deer tag) — such programs come and go; check with Utah DWR’s veterans outreach.
  * **Free Utah State ID or Concealed Carry Permit:** Utah’s Concealed Firearm Permit (CFP) fee is waived for active duty military, but not explicitly for disabled vets. Some sheriffs might waive the fingerprint fee for a 100% vet. It’s worth asking when applying.
  * **Local Recreation:** Many local rec centers offer **free membership** to 100% disabled residents. For example, Salt Lake County senior centers and rec centers often waive fees for those with 100% disability. The veteran should inquire at their city or county recreation office. Even if no policy, showing the 100% letter might get a courtesy membership.
  * **Retail/Merchant Benefits:** Outside government, many businesses give deeper discounts to 100% disabled vets. For instance, Home Depot and Lowe’s offer 10% to all vets (with signup), but some car dealerships or retailers may have specials for 100% (like additional rebates on cars – some manufacturers have programs for totally disabled vets).

* **Education Benefits:**

  * **Dependents Education (Chapter 35 DEA):** **This now becomes available**. If the veteran is rated 100% **Permanent & Total**, their spouse and children are eligible for DEA benefits. Each child (ages 18–26 generally) and the spouse (within 10 years of eligibility) can receive a monthly stipend (\~\$1,401 in 2025) while enrolled in school or vocational training. In Utah, this can be used at any accredited institution. This is a federal benefit. The dependents apply for Chapter 35 on VA’s website using the veteran’s information.
  * **Fry Scholarship:** If the 100% rating is due to the veteran’s death (posthumous), Fry Scholarship (which mirrors the Post-9/11 GI Bill) would cover children/spouse. But assuming the veteran is living with 100%, Fry doesn’t apply – that’s for KIA or died of service.
  * **Utah Scott Lundell Tuition Waiver:** Not applicable unless the veteran died in the line of duty. However, **some states** (not Utah) have free tuition for children of 100% vets. If any dependents want to study out-of-state, check that state’s offerings. For example, neighboring Colorado waives tuition for children of 100% P\&T vets.
  * **Scholarships:** Many organizations offer scholarships to children of 100% disabled vets (Paralyzed Veterans of America, etc.). Now that the veteran has reached 100%, the family should mention that when seeking aid, as it often meets eligibility criteria.
  * **Property Tax for Education:** Note, Utah’s property tax exemption for 100% vets can reduce funding to local schools (since property tax funds schools). This is accounted for by the state – but the veteran can feel free to use that savings perhaps to contribute to their own grandkids’ 529 college fund if they wish, as a way to “pay it forward” (just a thought on using the financial benefit).
  * **Veteran’s Own Education:** If the veteran still wants to take classes (for personal growth or new skills), at 100% they can use the **Forever GI Bill** (if they still have entitlement left) without worrying about working. Additionally, many colleges offer free or discounted tuition to senior or disabled persons for auditing courses. The vet could likely take classes at Utah State or University of Utah at low cost via non-credit programs for seniors/disabled.
  * **Vocational Rehabilitation (Chapter 31) for Dependents:** There is no direct VR\&E for dependents, but Chapter 35 now offers some counseling benefits for them. Also, if the veteran can’t use their VR\&E entitlement, sometimes a spouse who is also a caregiver might get career services through Department of Labor programs or the VA’s caregiver support (some caregiver training/education programs exist).

* **Healthcare Benefits:**

  * **VA Medical (Priority Group 1):** Same as 50%+, the veteran pays nothing for VA care. As 100%, they are in the highest priority for appointments and services.
  * **VA Dental Care:** **Comprehensive dental care is now provided to 100% disabled veterans** at the VA. This is a big addition if they hadn’t gotten dental before. The vet can get all dental work (cleanings, fillings, dentures, implants if needed for medical reasons) for free. They should enroll in the VA dental service; typically the VA will send a letter or automatically enroll them when the rating hits 100%. This includes routine care and major procedures.
  * **CHAMPVA for Dependents:** If the veteran is 100% P\&T and not retired military (i.e., family not eligible for TRICARE), the spouse and children are eligible for **CHAMPVA health insurance**. CHAMPVA is a VA-run program that covers most healthcare services for dependents (similar to TRICARE Standard). They will have minimal cost shares. For a 100% vet’s family, this is crucial if they don’t have other insurance. They must apply to VA for CHAMPVA; once enrolled, they get ID cards and can use civilian doctors that accept CHAMPVA. Many families use CHAMPVA as primary or secondary insurance.
  * **Vision and Hearing:** At 100%, VA covers eyeglasses and hearing aids by default if needed (even at lower ratings if service-connected, but at 100% basically any need, SC or not, is covered). They also cover routine eye exams. The veteran should make sure to use these benefits – e.g., get quality hearing aids from VA if they have any hearing loss.
  * **Long-Term Care:** As noted earlier, a veteran rated **70% or higher can get nursing home care paid by VA**. At 100%, if the vet ever needs nursing home placement (either in a VA contract home or state veterans home), they will not have to pay. VA will cover the full cost. This extends to VA’s in-home care programs too, which can be expanded at 100% since the vet is considered catastrophically disabled often.
  * **Caregiver Support:** If the veteran has a caregiver (often a spouse) due to inability to self-care, the **Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers** likely already covers them. At 100%, the stipend for the caregiver is usually at the highest tier (if the vet is completely dependent). This stipend can be over \$2,750 per month (approx, varies by locality) paid to the caregiver. It also gives the caregiver access to CHAMPVA (if they aren’t otherwise insured) and training/support.
  * **Medical Equipment & Prosthetics:** The VA provides any medically needed equipment – hospital bed, electric scooter, specialized wheelchair, oxygen, etc., at no cost. At 100%, the vet should ensure their home is fitted with whatever they need. The VA Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant up to \$6,800 (since SC) can fund things like roll-in showers or widened doors if not already done. Combined with possibly SAH or VR\&E IL help, the veteran’s home can be made fully accessible.
  * **Telehealth and VIP Services:** The VA often has a program for very high disability vets where they provide priority scheduling, a dedicated social worker or case manager, and telehealth devices (like an iPad for VA telehealth) for convenience. The vet should inquire about the **VA’s Home Telehealth** program if they have chronic conditions to monitor (they provide a device that sends vitals to VA). The vet likely qualifies for pretty much any pilot program or new initiative the VA has to improve care for disabled vets.
  * **Mental Health:** If 100% due in part to mental health, the veteran should consider whether they want to engage in any of the **VA’s wellness programs** (e.g., Whole Health Initiative, which provides things like yoga, acupuncture, meditation classes free for vets). There’s an emphasis on holistic health now, and the 100% disabled population is a prime target for these beneficial programs to improve quality of life.
  * **Alternative Care:** VA can refer 100% P\&T vets for community care more easily if needed (under the Mission Act if VA wait is too long or distance too far). The veteran basically has top priority for outsourced care if VA can’t directly provide timely, especially because of their status.
  * **Medicare:** If the veteran is eligible for Medicare (by age or SSDI), they should still enroll in Part A & B. Many 100% vets opt to not get extra insurance because VA covers almost everything. But having Medicare as backup is wise for emergencies outside VA. CHAMPVA for family requires the family to enroll in Medicare when eligible (spouse at 65 for example).

* **Employment & Vocational:**

  * **Working at 100%:** If schedular 100%, a veteran *can* legally work (unlike TDIU where working above marginal income is disallowed). But practically, most 100% vets are not working due to their conditions. If the veteran is an unusual case of being 100% for a condition but can still maintain employment (like some mental health conditions can be rated 100% but wax and wane), they need to be cautious. Earning a high income won’t reduce VA comp (VA comp isn’t means-tested), but it could trigger a re-evaluation if it starkly contradicts the disability picture (though P\&T means no routine future exams).
  * **Vocational Rehab (Chapter 31) Post-100%:** Generally, VR\&E is aimed at getting vets to employability. If a vet is 100% P\&T, VR\&E may determine they’re not feasible for employment, and instead might offer **Independent Living services**. If not already used, the veteran could get IL support (like life skills training, at-home hobby supplies, etc.) to enhance independence and quality of life. VR\&E IL services can even pay for things like a computer, exercise equipment, or home improvements to facilitate independent living goals.
  * **Education for Fun:** The veteran can still use their GI Bill for non-traditional study, or maybe transfer to a dependent if they hadn’t and were still within transfer eligibility rules while serving. If the vet never used Post-9/11 and was discharged before it existed, they unfortunately can’t transfer it now. But maybe they could use it themselves for online courses if desired.
  * **Volunteer/Employment:** Many 100% vets focus on advocacy or hobbies. However, if a 100% vet does want to attempt work or a hobby business, they can do so without losing their VA comp (again, unless they are 100% via TDIU, in which case it’s not allowed). Some 100% schedular vets run small businesses or consult part-time. They should be mindful of not pushing beyond their health limits. Utah’s VR\&E office or Small Business Administration can provide advice if they do consider a venture.
  * **Employment Protections:** At this level, the ADA would require extreme accommodations. It might not be realistic to work in a competitive job, but if they do, they have all the rights of any disabled person plus veteran preferences if in public sector. For example, if a 100% vet does work for the federal government, they get special consideration in **Retention** (RIF) – essentially they’re last to be laid off due to their 30%+ disability preference.
  * **Post-100% Reviews:** The veteran should know that if they are schedular 100% but not P\&T, the VA could schedule future exams (though uncommon at 100% unless it’s a temporary rating). Once they’ve been 100% for 5 years, it’s harder for VA to reduce; after 10 years, service connection is protected; after 20 years, the rating itself is protected from reduction (except fraud). If P\&T, they won’t schedule exams and reductions are rare unless obvious improvement.

* **License/Plates/Travel:**

  * **Commissary/Base Privileges:** Already had them, but note: 100% **Permanent** disabled veterans are eligible for a DoD Uniformed Services ID Card (Tan color ID, DD Form 2765) that says “100% Disabled Veteran”. This ID is essentially equivalent to a military retiree ID for base access. It allows entry for the veteran and any dependents with their own cards. The veteran can get this card from a military ID office with their VA award letter. This can be handy because the VHIC only works at the gate when scanned; the DoD ID will let them sponsor guests on base, etc., and might be accepted for base amenities like gyms that the VHIC might not.
  * **Military Base Recreation:** With the DoD ID or VHIC, 100% vets have full access to MWR. Notably, many bases (subject to local command) allow 100% disabled vets to use the **base fitness centers**. Hill AFB’s policy as of recent years does allow 100% DAVs to use the gym and swimming pool (they check the ID at sign-in). The vet can confirm with the base, but DoD guidance generally opened fitness centers to Purple Heart, former POW, and 100% DAV in 2020. So this is a great benefit for health.
  * **Space-A Flights:** A big travel benefit – under the **Disabled Veterans Access to Space-A Travel Act**, veterans **with a permanent 100% service-connected disability (or TDIU permanent)** are eligible for **Space-Available military flights**. They fly as Category 6 (same as retirees). They can travel within CONUS and to/from US overseas territories (Hawaii, Alaska, PR, Guam, etc.) on Air Force transports when seats are open. They need a DoD ID or VHIC to sign up. This can save a lot on travel. *Note:* They cannot use Space-A for OCONUS beyond U.S. territories due to host nation agreements (so no Europe or Asia Space-A unless going to Guam).
  * **TSA Precheck:** All veterans can use mil ID at some airports for shorter lines, but 100% disabled vets with DoD IDs might also be eligible for free TSA Precheck (DoD civilians and mil get it by entering an ID number, but not sure if DAV IDs have that – if not, many credit cards reimburse Precheck fee or sometimes USO gives codes).
  * **Airport Parking:** The Salt Lake City Airport parking benefit for DV plates still applies. The vet might travel more often now (Space-A or bucket list trips). They get **5 days free in garage, 10 days free in economy** each time. They should show their DV plate or 100% ID at exit. Many other airports beyond Utah also offer free parking for 100% DV (e.g., Jackson Hole, Denver (50% off), etc.) – always worth asking when traveling.
  * **Auto Purchase and Adaptation:** If not done: a 100% vet with certain disabilities (loss of limbs, severe orthopedic) likely already got the one-time VA auto grant. If not, at 100% they might not qualify unless specific criteria. But all 100% vets can get **adaptive equipment** for their car (hand controls, spinner knobs, etc.) through VA. They just need a physician’s prescription and VA Prosthetics will pay for it.
  * **No Registration Fee in Some States:** If the veteran ever moves, note that many states waive vehicle registration fees for 100% disabled vets. (In Utah, as said, registration *fees* per se are only waived for Purple Heart, but property tax portion is covered by the exemption anyway.)
  * **HOV/Toll Benefits:** Some states allow 100% disabled vets free toll or HOV access. Utah currently does not exempt DV from express lane fees except the general 2+ carpool rule. However, if the vet travels to, say, Texas, they should know TX gives toll-free travel to certain DV plates. California also just started allowing free HOT lane use for vehicles with DV plates in some areas. So outside Utah, their DV plate might have perks.
  * **Fishing/Hunting Lifetime:** The veteran could lobby UTDWR for a lifetime fishing license. Not codified, but some states present a Golden Lifetime license to 100% vets.

* **Housing:**

  * **Mortgage-Free Opportunities:** Some charities focus on 100% disabled vets for mortgage-free homes (like Homes For Our Troops, Tunnel to Towers). If the veteran’s housing is unstable or inadequate, they might reach out to such organizations. HFOT, for example, builds specially adapted houses for severely injured (usually amputees, etc.), but if the vet fits criteria and still needs a better home, 100% helps in eligibility.
  * **Property Tax Note:** In Utah, once a veteran (or their surviving spouse) is approved for the 100% exemption, they typically do not need to reapply each year, unless there’s a change. The county may verify occupancy periodically, but it’s mostly automatic renewal. The vet should ensure they meet any deadlines to submit verification if requested.
  * **Assistance for Utilities:** While not specifically a 100% vet program, the veteran might qualify for utility discounts. For instance, Rocky Mountain Power and Dominion Energy in Utah have low-income energy assistance programs. VA comp might put them above the threshold, but if they have high medical expenses, they might still be considered. Some cities (like SLC) waive water/sewer base fees for disabled residents – worth checking locally.
  * **VA Home Loan Funding Fee:** If the veteran ever uses a VA Home Loan (new purchase or refinance), note that **veterans with ANY service-connected disability are exempt from the VA funding fee**. So at 100%, they definitely pay no funding fee (which saves thousands on a home loan). This was true even at 10%, but a reminder if they decide to buy a new home or refinance for better rates, they should assert this exemption.

* **State Veteran Homes & Long-Term Care:**

  * At 100%, if the veteran needs long-term nursing care, the cost at a Utah State Veterans Home is covered by the VA entirely (due to 70%+ SC rule). The four state vet homes (Ogden, SLC, Payson, Ivins) each have skilled nursing. The vet would only pay comfort expenses (like phone, cable). The spouse of a 100% vet could also live there, but the spouse would have to pay regular fees (though sometimes reduced if the vet is 100% and occupying a bed, the spouse might get a discount for co-locating).
  * **Death & Burial Benefits:**

    * The veteran is entitled to free burial in a national or state veterans cemetery (plot, headstone, opening/closing). Their spouse and dependent children can be buried with them (spouse usually for a small fee at state cemetery; free at national). There’s a VA burial allowance (currently \$2,000 for service-connected death, or \~\$828 for non-service death if vet was 100% P\&T) to assist with funeral costs.
    * If the veteran’s death is service-connected, as mentioned, their spouse gets DIC and the property tax exemption continues for the spouse at 100%. The spouse also continues CHAMPVA for life (or until remarriage) and could use education benefits (Chapter 35) for up to 20 years after the vet’s death.
    * The **Utah Fallen Veteran** property tax exemption (for KIA or died of service causes) covers all property completely – which effectively the 100% cap already nearly did, but the distinction is the cap is removed if KIA.

* **Local Community Programs and Honors:**

  * **Veterans Organizations:** A 100% disabled vet likely will be engaged with DAV (Disabled American Veterans). Utah’s DAV network can provide free transportation (if needed) and also help the veteran file any additional claims (like SMC). At 100%, the veteran can also help others – some of the best service officers are themselves 100% disabled vets helping their peers navigate the system.
  * **Honorary License Plates:** In addition to the DV plate, the veteran might be eligible for others: e.g., if they have a Purple Heart, use that plate; if they received the Medal of Honor or other high decoration, there are special plates (very rare). There’s also a “Disabled Veteran Gold Star” plate for families of fallen (not applicable to the vet themselves).
  * **Community Recognition:** Communities often honor their 100% disabled vets. For example, Ogden or Salt Lake City might have veteran of the year awards. The veteran may be invited to speak at schools or events about their service (if they’re comfortable). Sometimes, local news profiles veterans with full disabilities to highlight their stories around Veterans Day.
  * **Recreation & Quality of Life:** The veteran should take advantage of programs like **Honor Flights** (if they are a wartime vet, to DC memorials – though priority goes to WWII/Korea, some Vietnam vets are being taken now). Also, organizations like **Huntsman Heroes** or **Team Red, White & Blue** offer adaptive sports and social activities for veterans to stay active and connected.
  * **Mental Health & Social Connection:** Isolation can be a challenge for 100% disabled vets. The Hill AFB area has a strong military community; the vet can plug into base events open to all vets (air shows, base museum, etc.). Also, the VA and nonprofits host retreats for 100% vets (Project Healing Waters for fly fishing, etc.). The vet’s spouse or caregiver can also find support in groups like **Caregivers on the Homefront** or local caregiver support meetups.
  * **Utah Veteran Benefits Fairs:** The Utah DVM (Department of Veterans & Military Affairs) periodically holds outreach events. At 100%, the veteran has essentially unlocked everything, but attending these events can reveal small benefits or community programs (like free holiday meals, or assistive technology demos, etc.). It’s also a way to keep updated on any new state legislation benefiting vets.
  * **Advocacy:** The 100% vet can use their experience to advocate for others. Utah is always refining veteran benefits – for instance, the increase of the property tax exemption cap was likely due to veteran input. If the vet sees a gap (like Utah not waiving registration fees broadly, or lack of dependent tuition waivers), they can work with groups (UVLC – Utah Veterans Legislative Council, etc.) to push for changes. Being 100% gives their voice weight in those discussions.
